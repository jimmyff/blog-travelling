Merry Christmas to you all!

Hope you have a fabulous day. We’ve had a big turkey dinner at the harbour here in Phnom Penh & we’re now getting ready for an afternoon & evening of drinking and dancing on a boat cruising down the Mekong! Hope Santa is kind to you all! x

P.S We wrote the message in the sand in Phu Quoc earlier this week!
 
P.P.S I tried to get my hair white for Christmas although it hasn’t quite got there yet! >_<
