Hey everyone!

Since our last post we went on a Thai cookery course which was LOADS of fun! We did it through the Chiang Mai Thai Cookery School which is owned and run by Sompian Nabnian, a famous Thai TV chef, and the course was done at his house. We learnt how to cook six Thai dishes: Hot & Sour Prawn Soup (Tom Yam Goong), Green Curry, Thai Fish Cakes, Thai Fried Noodles (Phad Thai), Minced Pork Northern Style and a Water Chestnuts dessert. They were all really tasty (if we do say so ourselves!) so you’ll have test our new found culinary skills when we’re back!

The following day (Thursday 11th November) we got a bus to Chiang Rai. Chiang Rai is a much smaller town than Chiang Mai with a few temples and a river running through it called the Mae Nam Kok. The weather has continued to be gorgeous (32 degrees) so the first couple of days we explored the town and visited a few temples as well as lounging at the park and stopping for a few drinks and snacks along the way.

We’ve been on a Trek today which was great but we’re both shattered this evening! We were picked up this morning and taken to the Mae Nam Kok river where we got a longboat to an elephant park. We rode an elephant called Rina (which we fed bananas and sugar cane after her hard work) and then we started our trek through the Chiang Rai National Park (450,000 acres). The Trek was really tough and we were both absolutely wet with sweat for the entirety of it. On the way we visited two hill tribes (Akha & Lahu), stopped at the biggest waterfall in Chiang Rai, walked through a Chinese tea plantation (which was beautiful) and then finished off at a hot spa where we had a much needed rest in the water. We also saw a gecko and two snakes!!! We had a brilliant guide called Simon (English version of his name) who was with us for the whole day telling us all about Thai culture and our surroundings.

We’re just about to start packing as we’re getting picked up in 8 hours to start our two day journey to Luang Prabang in Laos, the next part of our adventure!

Missing you all, but not too much! Ha!
