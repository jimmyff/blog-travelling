‘Sawatdee’ (Hello) from Bangkok!! It’s our third night in Thailand and we’re lovin’ it!!

Arrived on Sunday and after checking in to our Hotel (Lamphu House) in Banglamphu, we headed out for thai curries and beers around Soi Rambutri & Khao San Road. On Monday we went (window) shopping around the Siam area, had a few coffees, shakes, cakes etc. We had plenty of beers and found a really good restaurant just down the road from our hotel. On our way back to the hotel we decided to try the fish spa (as recommended by James & David!), it was sooo ticklish at first but after a few minutes we loved it! Today (Tuesday) we’ve explored China Town (and had a very authentic meal; not quite sure what it was but it tasted good!) and then went to Pat Pong for a wander around the night market and a few beers at the bars!

There have been a couple of tropical storms (briefly with lots of lightning and heavy rain) but luckily we’ve mostly missed them. The temperature here is crazy, it’s *SO* hot & sticky all the time although I think we’re slowly aclimatising to it! 

We’re getting the overnight bus tomorrow to Ranong and from there we’ll travel to Ko Phayam, our first island! Bangkok has been a blast but now we’re totally ready for the beaches!!
We’ve attached a few snaps, will post more in a few days.

Update: We drafted this last night but didn’t get a chance to send it. Today we climbed the ‘Golden Mountain’ a really high temple which gave us amazing panoramic views of the city. We’re currently waiting for our overnight bus to Ranong. Our brand new Sony camera went a bit crazy so we’ve had to send it off (via Sony Centre) for repair! Unfortunately that means we probably won’t be attaching photos for a while. We’ve got a few disposables to tide us over and should get our camera back in a couple of weeks!!
